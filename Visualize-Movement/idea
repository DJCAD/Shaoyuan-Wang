My improved idea is some attachment which can be attatched on your body or the things you are using with some movements, like the mop when you mopping floor, or the knife when you're chopping vegetables. 
And I want to visualize those movements. 
Then your friends will be curious what kind of activities you are doing.  
It is also a signal that you are inviting people to join.
