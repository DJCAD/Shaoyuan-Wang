I studied interior & environmental design during undergraduate period. So I have used a few design programs for graphic and 3D model. 
I like sketching on my note book to display my ideas in order to make my concept in order and clear. 
I also like making physical models which support the concept. 
But I haven't much experience with editing video. And I haven't done any design with code before, so it was big challenge for me.

So I would like to be assessed on my design thinking progress and physical prototype. 
I feel quite confident with my sketches of stories, which shows how did my concept grow. 
I also enjoyed editing the video even though I am new to the software.
But I could not make exact portable attatchment as wristband. The prototype with massive wires looks a bit stupid in video. 
However, I am happy it works in the way I want.
